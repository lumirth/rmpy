# RateMyProfessors Python Module

This is a Python module for interacting with RateMyProfessors.com's GraphQL API. It provides functions to search for schools, search for teachers, get teacher information, and fetch all professors from a school.

Please note, the way constants are currently set up, if you do not specify a university ID, it will default to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign[^1].

I wrote it for [a project I'm working on](https://warlock.mirth.cc/). This module was inspired greatly by [Michigan Technical University's NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mtucourses/rate-my-professors).

[^1]: I bet you can't guess what university I attend.
