# RateMyProfessors Python Module

This is a Python module for interacting with RateMyProfessors.com's GraphQL API. It provides functions to search for schools, search for teachers, get teacher information, and fetch all professors from a school.

I wrote it for a project I'm working on, inspired greatly by [Michigan Technical University's NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mtucourses/rate-my-professors).
